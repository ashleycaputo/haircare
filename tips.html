						<p>One of the best things you can do for your hair is to keep it away from heat. When washing your hair, make sure that you use cold water to seal your cuticle. Doing this will reduce frizz.</p>

						<p>Letting your hair air dry is better than blow drying it because it prevents your hair from getting heat damage. Also, try to stay away from a flat iron or curling iron as much as possible to prevent heat damage. However, if you absolutly have to use one, make sure to use a heat protectant spray.</p>

						<p>Another way you can reduce frizz is to dry your hair with a tshirt. A tshirt absorbs more of the water from your hair and is gentle on your hair compared to a towel. This will keep your hair frizz free as a result.</p>

						<p>Some good shampoo and conditioner to use is anything from the Organix brand. Organix uses natural ingrediants and isn't too expensive.</p>

						<p>If you want your hair to look shiny and heatlhy I recommend the Brazilian Keratin Therapy shampoo and conditioner by  Organix.</p>

						<p>When applying any type of shampoo or conditioner, make sure to only use the size of a quarter and only apply conditioner to the strands of your hair. If you apply conditioner to the roots of your hair, your scalp will get greasy. This is because your roots already produce a natural oil.</p>
